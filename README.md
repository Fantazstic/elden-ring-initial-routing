# Elden Ring Routing WIP
Created by Soldat#0638
## Information
The default Any% FQ WW route currently uses wrong warps. Any% Glitchless routing is still WIP, but you can still access the wrong warp areas through normal means.
## How to contribute or make your own routing
1. You can turn on the edit mode in the left side panel, add a new layer with the name "route".
2. Place polylines to show player movement around the map.
3. Export the route layer
4. Create another layer named "markers" and add markers for items, bosses, fast travels or steps along the route.
5. When placing a marker you can edit the marker information, use "id" for the marker name and "description" for further information.
6. Export the marker layer.
7. You should now have 2 `.json` files, open a PR with both files attached so they can be added to the map!
