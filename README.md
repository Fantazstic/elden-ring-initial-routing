# Elden Ring Routing WIP
Created by Soldat#0638
## Information
The route currently uses no wrong warps, it was tested and developed before consistent wrong warps were found.
## How to contribute
You can turn on the edit mode in the side panel, place your marker(s) and export them in the edit side panel through the lowermost button.
It'll give you a geoJson with all markers of the edit layer, then open a PR once you're done with changes.
